> - program counter
> - accumulator
> - status

## To create the assembler executable

```shell
$ cd ./SP1Assembler
$ make
```

## To assemble the Assembly program

```shell
$ ./SP1Assembler/sp1a <file_name> -o <binary_file_name>
```

## To run the emulator

```shell
$ make
$ sp1_run <binary_file_name>
```
